## REopt API Analysis Notebook

This notebook outlines an analysis that explores how different load shapes
affect the optimial sizing and dispatch of a solar PV system paired with battery
energy storage. The easiest way to explore this notebook is through the
[Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/NREL/REopt-API-Analysis/class_updates?urlpath=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FNREL%2FREopt-API-Analysis%2Fblob%2Fclass_updates%2Fnotebooks%2FREopt_Lite_API_Demo.ipynb)
implementation. Otherwise you will need to have jupyter installed on your
machine with a kernel that has all of the `requirements.txt` dependencies
installed.
